Android ActionBarCompat-ShareActionProvider Sample
===================================

This sample shows you how a provide a context-sensitive ShareActionProvider with
ActionBarCompat, backwards compatible to API v7.

Introduction
------------

The sample contains a [`ViewPager`][1] which displays content of differing types: image and
text. When a new item is selected in the ViewPager, the [`ShareActionProvider`][2] is updated with
a share intent specific to that content.

This Activity extends from [`ActionBarActivity`][3], which provides all of the function
necessary to display a compatible Action Bar on devices running Android v2.1+.
